##  Update information for NConf 1.2.4 to 1.2.5   ##
####################################################

##------------------------------------------------##
##       Changes to the NConf configuration       ##
##------------------------------------------------##

The following configuration option(s) have been added:
$STATIC_CONFIG

Add the following line(s) to your 'config/nconf.php' file:
$STATIC_CONFIG = array("static_cfg");

This new option is mandatory. If you do not add it to your configuration, NConf will not
work properly and you will not be able to use NConf until you've done so.

Here is some additional information about the new option. For more detailed information,
please refer to the 'config.orig' folder or to the online documentation.

---
# Static Nagios configuration files

# CAUTION: Static files will not be syntax checked by NConf!
# List of folders containing additional files that you would like to make editable within NConf (basic text editing).
# All folders listed here will be included in the output file, together with the generated config.
# We recommend you to copy your static files into the 'nconf/static_cfg' folder.

# If security permits it, you could make your active Nagios configuration editable in NConf directly.
# We discourage users from doing this though, because there is a risk that they could accidentally damage their Nagios configuration.

##------------------------------------------------##
##              Additional changes                ##
##------------------------------------------------##

For security reasons, the file 'config/.file_accounts' has been replaced by 
'config/.file_accounts.php'. Please remove the old '.file_accounts' file 
and replace it with the new .php file from the 'config.orig' folder.

If you are using Auth by file, make sure you migrate any existing accounts to the new file also.
Please note that the separator/delimiter has been changed to "::" (2 colons). You will have
to replace any "," (commas) after copying your users to the new file.

The 'URLROOTPATH' constant has become obsolete. You may remove it from your 'config/nconf.php' file.
