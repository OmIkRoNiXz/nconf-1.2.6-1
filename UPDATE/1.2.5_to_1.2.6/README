##  Update information for NConf 1.2.5 to 1.2.6   ##
####################################################

##------------------------------------------------##
##       Changes to the NConf configuration       ##
##------------------------------------------------##

The following configuration option(s) have been added:
- SELECT_VALUE_SEPARATOR
- OVERVIEW_QUANTITY_STANDARD

Add the following line(s) to your 'config/nconf.php' file:

define('SELECT_VALUE_SEPARATOR', "::");

This new option is mandatory for proper operation of NConf. The default is "::".
This defines the seperator which splits the values of "select" type attributes.

define('OVERVIEW_QUANTITY_STANDARD', "25");

This new option is optional. If you do not add it to your configuration, NConf will 
display an unlimited amount of entries in the overview per default. We recommend to set the default to '25'.

##------------------------------------------------##
##              Additional changes                ##
##------------------------------------------------##

If you were using the 'service_is_stale' check_command as a 'dummy' check for passive-checked
services on your nagios-monitor server(s), you must now configure this explicitely under your 
'nagios-monitor' settings. This is no longer triggered by the 'active_checks_enabled' flag.

CAUTION (read carefully):

In version 1.2.6 the way some attributes are inherited from timeperiods has been changed!
In the past, the following attributes were written to hosts & services based on the 
'notification_period' you selected:
 - max_check_attempts
 - check_interval (services only)
 - retry_interval (services only)
 - notification_interval
 - notification_options

As of version 1.2.6, both 'check_period' and 'notification_period' are taken into account
when writing these attributes to hosts & services. 

This is how the mentioned attributes are assigned now:

Inherited from 'check_period':
 - max_check_attempts
 - check_interval (services only)
 - retry_interval (services only)

Inherited from 'notification_period':
 - notification_interval
 - notification_options

If this is a problem for you, we have supplied a patch file under 'ADD-ONS/ExportNagios.pm.PATCH'.
Simply overwrite 'bin/lib/NConf/ExportNagios.pm' with the patch to undo the mentioned changes.
Please be advised that this is a temporary work-around and will be discontinued in future versions.

Please consider the following:

The following attributes have now also been implemented within the context of 
host- & services templates, and are therefore DEPRECATED and will be removed 
in one of the upcoming releases:

Attributes under 'timeperiods':

 - max check attempts
 - check interval
 - retry interval
 - notification interval
 - host notification options
 - service notification options

Attributes under 'nagios-collectors / monitors':

 - active checking
 - passive checking
 - notification enabled
 - check freshness
 - freshness threshold

Please discontinue using these attributes and instead configure these parameters 
using host- & service-templates.
